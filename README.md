# Solving Rosalind with Rust

## Computing a problem
Run `cargo run` by specifying bin name and a path to dataset file as an argument. For example,

```rust
cargo run --bin ba1d -- ./rosalind_ba1d.txt
```

where `ba1d` is a problem identifier as in [the problem URL](http://rosalind.info/problems/ba1d/), and `rosalind_ba1d.txt` is the dataset file downloaded from the website.
